x# patternFinder
this software can be used to look for meta pattern within whole numbers permutations

Input:	int n, meta-pattern description
Output:	list of n-permutations that avoid the pattern and those that contains it

Usage (by cmd): #python pattfinder.py n M
	* n: can be any positive integer
	* M: must be a meta pattern of permutations, like 231, 12, 312,...

NEXT TO IMPLEMENT:
	launching the program with more than one pattern as arguments
	saving log files for both lists
